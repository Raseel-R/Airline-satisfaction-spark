## 🔹 Technologies Used

- Apache Spark (RDD, SQL, MLlib)  
- PySpark  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

---

## 🔹 Key Deliverables

- Analytical insights on demographics, delays, service features, and satisfaction.
- Visual comparisons using SQL queries and RDD transformations.
- Built and evaluated ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and GBT.
